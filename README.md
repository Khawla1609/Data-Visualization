Data processing refers to the act of cleaning, transforming, and manipulating data to make it usable for analysis and visualization. This process can involve tasks such as removing missing or duplicate data, formatting data into a consistent structure, and calculating derived variables.

Data visualization, on the other hand, is the process of creating graphical representations of data in order to communicate insights and information. This can include creating charts, graphs, maps, and other types of visualizations. Data visualization is usually done after data processing is completed, as the data need to be cleaned, transformed and in the right format to be visualised.

Together, data processing and data visualization form an important part of the data science workflow, as they allow analysts to gain insights and make decisions based on the data they are working with.
